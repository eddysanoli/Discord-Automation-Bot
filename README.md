# Automation Discord Bot

Discord bot that's meant to automate different tasks. Currently it only allows me to automatically bring up and bring back down a gaming server that I use for my friends, but soon enough I'll be adding more features.

## Deployment

Make sure to add the same repository secrets on Github as in the "Eddysanoli.com" repo in order to have the github actions work. Also don't forget that this repo requires a `.env` file with the required tokens. Copy it into the server where you are deploying the project.
